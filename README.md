Martin Kovachev
Web developer

Hello Reader :),
My name is Martin and I am an enthusiastic (in many aspects such as swimming, football, table tennis, fitness...) and a web developer who would like to improve his skills in programming over new horizonts in his professional and spare time. My main abilities are front-end and  a lot of back-end programming (ASP.NET Core, Angular 2+, ReactJS, JScript and so on...). My aims are to create something that people will love to use daily, will be handy and under the hood will be written a lot of nice and beautiful code. Have a nice and smiley day from me :).
